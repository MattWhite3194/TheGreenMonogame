TODO:

Collisions:
Look up how to properly apply collisions, for now at least they're even
Fix right side collisions not detecting properly
Water:
add shading for water
draws above literally everything except backgrounds

Fixes:
Drawing order for sprites
fix item collision with tiles floating downwards
design better damage system
Implement tile culling
Fix Damaged tile sprite or change it's logic completely
get rid of globals file, it's stupid. move the time stuff either to main or a seperate class called time. move static variables to TheGreen or Main depending on their scope

Features:
Define Max stack value for each item, and set a default to like 1000 or something
add equipment (maybe make accessories input handlers, and store them in a list and call them before calling the players input)
Add doors
Save the game
walls
projectiles
Ambitious Features:
Split Screen

UI: 
if inventory was open on death, reopen it when you respawn
draw map to a render target2D the size of the map. 
Only draw to this render target when the map is updated, and draw the pixels at the coresponding positions.

Drawing Order:
player and entities draw above tiles, unless bool is set
item drops draw above everything
player draws above all enemies

Change TileData to abstract, and just implement each one seperately instead of the overriding mess I currently have.

export tileUpdating to UpdateTileFunction in WorldGen, Update tiles when liquid is set, for removal of tiles like grass or torches.

finish UIScaling
Add BottomRight and bottomLeft Anchors
Future note For sizes:
components must be further down and further right than the containers position or else they willl not be calculated in the containers size correctly, obviously.
