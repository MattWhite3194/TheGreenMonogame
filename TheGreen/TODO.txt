TODO:

Fixes:
Drawing order for sprites
fix item collision with tiles floating downwards
design better damage system
Implement tile culling
Fix Damaged tile sprite or change it's logic completely
finalize water (make it flow better)
get rid of globals file, it's stupid. move the time stuff either to main or a seperate class called time. move static variables to TheGreen or Main depending on their scope

Features:
Define Max stack value for each item, and set a default to like 1000 or something
add equipment (maybe make accessories input handlers, and store them in a list and call them before calling the players input)
add tile entities (start with chest and door)
Save the game
walls
Add Window resizing
projectiles
Ambitious Features:
Split Screen




UI: 
UI does not disappear, but can't open map or use items / scroll through inventory
if inventory was open on death, reopen it when you respawn
draw map to a render target2D the size of the map. 
Only draw to this render target when the map is updated, and draw the pixels at the coresponding positions.

Drawing Order:
player and entities draw above tiles, unless bool is set
item drops draw above all entities
player draws above all enemies

TileCanBeDamaged:
Solid tiles will check if the above is a tree or if its a large tile and the large tile can't be damaged.
Chests/InventoryTiles will check if their inventory is empty.

Change TileData to abstract, and just implement each one seperately instead of the overriding mess I currently have.

export tileUpdating to UpdateTileFunction in WorldGen, Update tiles when liquid is set, for removal of tiles like grass or torches.

finish UIScaling
add an enum type for anchors, (topleft, top right, bottom left, bottom right, centered), create matrices for each one of these or a function for getting translated position
